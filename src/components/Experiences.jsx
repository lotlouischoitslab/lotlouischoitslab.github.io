                  I am pursuing my M.S. in Civil Engineering (Transportation) under Professor Alireza Talebpour in the 
                  Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at UIUC. For my main research, I am analyzing various control spacing models 
                  such as constant spacing, constant time headway, traffic flow stability, constant safety factor, and intelligent driver model for 
                  Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) vehicles. I am also exploring how to leverage multi-agent deep 
                  reinforcement learning for trajectory planning for efficient and safe car-following and lane-changing behaviors of 
                  self-driving vehicles. In addition to this, I am collaborating on a motion planning and control development for a 
                  self-driving vehicle project, which is currently being tested at the Illinois Center for Transportation in Rantoul, Illinois. 
                  To simulate and validate planning and control algorithms on the physical vehicle, I use the Robot Operating System (ROS) to 
                  assess vehicle dynamics. I also collaborate on a project that leverages the Waymo Open Dataset to study vehicle 
                  motion behaviors, such as lane-changing patterns, to enhance our understanding of autonomous driving dynamics.

                  gatherings that provide both networking opportunities and a platform for knowledge exchange. Additionally, I serve as a 
                  mentor to prospective undergraduate students who express a strong interest in advancing to graduate studies. 
                  I offer insights into the academic and professional areas of transportation engineering, assist mentees in navigating the

                  machine learning algorithms to analyze and forecast public transit data. My role also extended to the UIUC 
                  Engineering Open House (EOH), where I proudly showcased our teamâ€™s projects. I provided mentoring to 
                  Civil Engineering (Transportation) majors and Computer Science majors and minors, offering guidance on curriculum 
                  planning and coursework selection. Moreover, I actively represented ITE@UIUC within the UIUC Engineering Council

                  I worked with Professor Alireza Talebpour in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering (Transportation) 
                  at UIUC. The objective of this project was to leverage GPT and Deep Reinforcement Learning for Traffic State Spacing. My 
                  primary task was to create a sequence-based simulation using LSTM neural networks enabling the agent to learn the state 
                  patterns. After the agent learns the state-action-state patterns by simulating the Markov Decision Process, the aim was to 
                  enable the agent to select the most optimal action for the next feasible state the vehicle can move to.

                I collaborated with Professor Sayan Mitra in the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department at UIUC 
                on the Verse Lane Map Generator for Control Verification Research. My primary tasks were extracting

                function to illustrate the road attributes from the ASAM OpenDRIVE file. Once the road geometry components were converted and
                visualized, they were deployed on the traffic simulator for control verification of the autonomous agents.
